# Inventory-Tracking-System
My student project; it will be a web-based inventory tracker for any kind of business.
There will be a database, containing several tables; what I can think of right now is Items, Suppliers, Profit, Workers, etc. I will add things as I go.
A super-user will be configurable, a person from the company with access to all postouts and locations.
The web-app should be built in a way so that it is easily applicable to many different business plans. For example, one could use it for both a library and a clothing store, an office inventory tracker or a restaurant's tracker.
I will seek to make the project as user-friendly as possible, so that the end-user can be anyone, without any IT background.
For now, I will leave the README file as this, and I will probably add more things as I get to learn them.
